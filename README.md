# Playfair Cipher

The Playfair Cipher is an encryption technique invented by Charles Wheatstone in 1854. It is a digraph substitution cipher that encrypts pairs of letters instead of single letters. The Playfair Cipher is notable for its simplicity and ease of use, making it one of the first ciphers to be used widely for practical purposes. This project is an implementation of the Playfair Cipher, designed to encrypt and decrypt text based on a given keyword.
